1st step involves setting up GCP VM with ubuntu + GPUs 
then need to get CUDA and CuDNN

-- maybe ask someone at work about VMs too ... 
-- as long as you don't delete, can get back in with everything still in it, right?
-- but then does it continue to get charged ...?

GCP billing ... some confusion around turning on/off properly
https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs/how-to/reports


-- issue was getting CUDA and CuDNN onto the virtual machine ...
-- also getting data up there too eventually 
-- should pull all of this in a GCS bucket i guess


## gets cuda up and running right

https://developer.nvidia.com/compute/machine-learning/cudnn/secure/v7.3.1/prod/9.0_2018927/Ubuntu16_04-x64/libcudnn7-dev_7.3.1.20-1-cuda9.0_amd64



tar.gz file or .deb ... ? 


### This has to be done not in the remote computer but in local file!!!
gcloud compute scp /Users/andrewju/Desktop/data-art-gan/libcudnn7-dev_7.3.1.20-1+cuda9.0_amd64.deb test-11-3-vm:/tmp


### always getting this error... wtf

sudo dpkg -i libcudnn7-dev_7.3.1.20-1+cuda9.0_amd64.deb 



libcudnn7-dev_7.3.1.20-1+cuda9.0_amd64.deb



https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/sdk/cudnn-install/index.html 

documentation works the best
need to do all 3 libraries at once each time




######## 
ok so now that VM properly set up ... 
how tf to actually run this? lets see 

# i thought this VM already had pytorch on it ... but lua commands not running so idk then


http://torch.ch/docs/getting-started.html#
- need to remember to install torch as well, not just download it 
- installation of torch ... some mixups too 
https://github.com/torch/distro/issues/239



-- need to put all of this into a script somehow... 


--- prob very useful to keep instance running after closing laptop, etc.
